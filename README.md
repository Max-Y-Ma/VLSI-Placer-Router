# VLSI-Placer-Router
Source Code for simple VLSI Quadratic Placer and Router.

## Description
- This repository contains the source code for both modules.
- To reference the VLSI Quadratic Placer, navigate to `placer/placer.py`
- To reference the VLSI Router, navigate to `router/router.py`

# VLSI Quadratic Placer
- This python module `QuadraticPlacer` implements a quadratic placer algorithm in 3 parts:
    - Placement of initial gates layout
    - Assignment of logic gates to left and right cutline
    - Containment of logic gates to solve left and right QP layouts 

## Usage
- Benchmarks for this module are run using a bash script `./run_placer.sh`

# VLSI Router
